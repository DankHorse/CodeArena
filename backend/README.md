# HackFlow Backend

## Setup

Use Python 3.10 or newer. From this directory, create a virtual environment,
install dependencies, and create your private local environment file from the
example. Replace `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` with your own URL-safe local password;
`.env` is gitignored.

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

The `DATABASE_URL` entry expands from the same username, password, database,
and port used by Docker Compose, so keep those settings together in `.env`.

Start the development server with `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`. The health
check is available at `/health`, and versioned API routes are mounted under
`/api/v1`.

## Database migrations

Start local PostgreSQL and apply migrations from this directory:

```sh
docker compose up -d postgres
alembic upgrade head
alembic current
```

PostgreSQL listens on host port `55433`, as configured by `POSTGRES_PORT`.
`alembic current` reports the database's migration revision.
When SQLAlchemy models are added, create migrations with:

```sh
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
```

No application tables are defined yet.

## Tests

Run the full backend test suite from this directory:

```sh
pytest
```

The PostgreSQL connectivity test runs when `DATABASE_URL` is set and skips
otherwise.
